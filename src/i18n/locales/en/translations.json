    "air_quality": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a scale used to communicate the level of air pollution in a particular region. It provides a standardized way to quantify and report the quality of the air to the general public, making it easier to understand the potential health impacts of air pollution. The AQI ranges from 0 to 500, where lower values represent better air quality and higher values indicate poorer air quality. The index is typically divided into color-coded categories, each associated with a specific level of health concern.",
    "pm2.5": "Particulate Matter 2.5 microns or smaller: PM2.5 is a type of air pollution that consists of small particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems in humans, including asthma, heart attacks, and lung cancer. PM2.5 is mainly produced by burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, and natural sources such as wildfires and dust storms.",
    "pm10": "PM10 are very small particles found in dust and smoke. They have a diameter of 10 micrometres (0.01 mm) or smaller. PM10 particles are a common air pollutant and are small enough to get into your throat and lungs. High levels of PM10 can make you cough, your nose run and eyes sting. People with heart or lung conditions might have more symptoms when PM10 levels are high. Symptoms can include wheezing, chest tightness or difficulty breathing.",
    "pm1": "PM1 are extremely fine particulates with a diameter of fewer than 1 microns. These are significantly smaller than PM 2.5. Their size is 70-100 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. PM1 particles cannot be filtered by the lungs and can cross the blood-brain barrier.",
    "no": "Nitrogen Oxides are a family of poisonous, highly reactive gases. These gases form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. NOx pollution is emitted by automobiles, trucks and various non-road vehicles (e.g., construction equipment).",
    "no2": "Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gases. Breathing air with a high concentration of NO2 can irritate airways in the human respiratory system. Such exposures over short periods can aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, leading to respiratory symptoms (such as coughing, wheezing or difficulty breathing), hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms.",
    "nh3": "Ammonia (NH3), colorless, pungent gas composed of nitrogen and hydrogen. High levels of ammonia can irritate and burn the skin, mouth, throat, lungs, and eyes. Very high levels of ammonia can damage the lungs or cause death.",
    "co": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and toxic gas that can cause health problems in humans, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion, and even death at high concentrations. CO is mainly produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, such as in car engines, and is a significant source of air pollution.",
    "o3": "Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms. Breathing ground-level ozone can trigger a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion. It can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Ozone also can reduce lung function and inflame the lining of the lungs. Repeated exposure may permanently scar lung tissue.",
    "uv_index": "UV-index is an international standard measurement of the strength of the sunburn-produced ultraviolet (UV) radiation at a particular place and time. It estimates the level of sun UV radiation hazard for human's skin.",
    "noise_pollution": "Noise pollution is unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health, wildlife, and environmental quality.",
    "humidity": "Humidity is the concentration of water vapor present in the air.",
    "air_pressure": "Air pressure is the force exerted by air, whether compressed or unconfined, on any surface in contact with it."
